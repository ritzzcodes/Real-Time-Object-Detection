# Real-Time-Object-Detection

In this project, we aim to develop a real-time object detection system using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The system will be capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within a video stream or live camera feed in real-time. The primary focus will be on achieving high accuracy, low latency, and scalability for various applications, such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and interactive environments.
